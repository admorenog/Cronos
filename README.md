Cronos
==========

# TODO
We need a way to register the executions and logs for a job to show the progress.
The crontab will have only one task? or a task for an individual job?

You can set a smtp config for a job (checks for error or/and success?)
Also you can configure hooks for every job (you can order the execution of the hooks)

save and backup buttons in jobs and environment tabs (should ask about saving in database, flush cached or add to crontab)

Name of backups: you can set a name for every backup.
Backups: should have 2 tabs: jobs and env, the env can be associated to a multiple jobs backup or database. when you restore a job ask to restore his env (show preview of everything).
